  <p>I always thought I stumbled into the cartooning world by chance, but the more I reflect on it, the more I realize that I have been cartooning my entire life. I recently sorted through some high school stuff, only to see that my notebooks were literally filled with comics. I also had an entire closet full of manga and other comic books. Like many cartoonists, Calvin and Hobbes and The Far Side defined my childhood.
I always loved art, and recently graduated from the Maryland Institute College of Art with a BFA in Illustration. When I was a sophomore in school, I posted a few comics on Tumblr for kicks, and when a few went somewhat viral, I decided that I could make my webcomic a serious project. During my senior year, one of my comics got accepted into the first-ever Comic and Cartooning Annual by the Society of Illustrators. Now, having been graduated for a few months, I make my career as a full-time cartoonist and illustrator.
 
I like making fun of myself and the world around me. My character, who is emotional, awkward, lazy and somewhat unstable, is a reflection of myself. I believe there are many universal qualities that most people have but don’t necessarily talk about, and that’s what I love to write about. My character is the complete opposite of cool, and drawing her is a relief because I can let my guard down and talk about what really makes up my inner world.
I have a strong aversion to anything that comes off as pretentious. Maybe four years at an art school finally did it, but I don’t have patience for anything (people, art, music) that tries to elevate itself above other people. That’s why I love comics – I love the honesty of humor and the gritty simplicity of comic artwork.
My character hangs out with a talking pet rabbit. This guy comes from a little buddy I had in high school, who was the calmest, most stoic rabbit you could ever meet.
When I was creating the comic, I realized that in order to prevent the main character from being too internal, she needed someone to bounce her thoughts off of. Partially inspired from my pet and partially from Hobbes, the rabbit serves as a quieter, more reflective counterpart to the loud craziness of “Sarah.”
 
Like my life, I feel like my webcomic is still in its earlier stages, despite having been around for a few years. I’ve just recently achieved syndication on GoComics, started writing comics for College Humor and have been designing an online class for Skillshare. I’m still experimenting with techniques, and have just picked illustration back up again to work on a zine with some friends from school. I’m a recent college grad in my early twenties, so my studio is a desk in my room with warped floors, and I’m still trying to learn how to balance my time.
That being said, I’m moving soon (yay for floors that aren’t warped!) and have a lot of projects that I’m happy to be working on. Everything seems to be moving forward and I’m getting the hang of being a working artist. I’m more than excited to keep making work.
