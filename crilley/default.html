  <p> I learned how to write at Hampton Elementary, a public school within walking distance from my childhood home in Detroit. Learned how to write, that is, in the see-Jane-go-see-Spot-run sense of the phrase. Learning how to really write—write well—is something I'll be working at until the day I die. But my first written sentences came into the world courtesy of Hampton Elementary.

I'm guessing it was around the year 1973, when I was in the second or third grade. My parents saved a nice big pile of papers from those days, and even now when I go to visit, they sometimes pull the pile out and let me sift through it.

There are stories I wrote about race-car drivers, men who turn invisible, and kids living in the future who take antigravity pills (or wear antigravity boots, or spend a good part of their lives—in some manner or another—defying gravity). There are the usual misspellings, letters flipped backwards, and sentences furiously erased or obliterated by pencil lead. And there are drawings. Always drawings.

I was the kid who could draw. There's one in every classroom, and I was the one in my classroom. My devotion to drawing was such that writing was definitely a secondary concern. In fact I'll bet I wrote stories simply to give myself something to illustrate. Which is still true of what I do to a certain extent. But more on that later.

I remember one school assignment that I loved. The idea was to describe a monster or some such creature in several sentences. Something like, "It has a dinosaur's body, a shark's head, and tusks like an elephant. It has seven legs and feet like a duck." Then everyone would have to switch papers and draw one another's monsters. I thought it was the coolest class activity ever devised. No doubt kids who hated to draw had a very different opinion. But I would have been content to do nothing else all day long for the rest of elementary school.

I can't talk about my early creative years without mentioning my parents and my two older brothers. My father and mother, Robert and Virginia Crilley, knew just how to encourage a young doodler like myself. They had a huge stack of white paper in a cupboard low enough to the floor that I could reach in there and grab several sheets at a time. There were plenty of pencils—number two Dixon Ticonderogas—and a good,

sturdy, electric pencil sharpener. The distance from the paper and pencils to the surface of the kitchen table was no more than four feet, and I took full advantage of the arrangement.

My parents were not artists. Still, my mother had a creative streak and was always making things for us: stuffed animals, superhero costumes. Perhaps even more importantly, she had—and still has—one of the prerequisites for acquiring a skill quickly. I call it "creative tunnel vision." When my mom gets into something, she's into it whole hog, with little time for anything else. By the time the fascination burns off, she has taught herself everything she needs to know about the subject, and then some. I've definitely inherited a fair amount of this, and it has served me well over the years in my writing, my artwork, and a great many other things.</p>
